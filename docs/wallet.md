# Coinbase Wallet

CubeChain EVM fully supports [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), a leading wallet for Ethereum based blockchains. In order to interact with the CubeChain using Coinbase Wallet, you need to add the CubeChain network.

The most convenient way to do this is via [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/), which curates a list of EVM networks. The CubeChain EVM mainnet and testnet are listed on Chainlist with ChainID 1818 and 1819, respectively. To add a chain to Coinbase Wallet, make sure the [Chrome browser extension](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/getting-started-extension) is enabled. Search “Cube” and press the “Connect Wallet” button, then "Connect". Confirm the connection if prompted. 

Now you are set up and ready to deposit, withdraw or send CUBE!

If you want to add the networks manually, you can find rpc and explorer infomation showing in the `MetaMask` section, or from [Mainnet info](mainnet.md) and [Testnet info](testnet.md)

# Ledger

This tutorial describes how to access your Ledger Cube (CUBE) account via MetaMask.

### Before you start

Make sure to update Ledger Live to the latest version via [this link][link].
Open Ledger Live and connect your Ledger device to the Manager to ensure that your Ledger device is running the latest firmware version.
Ensure that the latest version of the [Ethereum (ETH) app][app] is installed on your Ledger device.
Once you're all done, close Ledger Live as it can conflict with Metamask.

### Can I use the Cube (CUBE) app instead of the Ethereum (ETH) app?

* The Cube (CUBE) app is an experimental feature that is still pending review by the Ledger team.
* Using the app is safe but you might encounter some minor UI bugs.
* Once such a bug prevented Metamask from completing transactions created with the Ledger Cube (CUBE) app.
* A fix will be deployed as soon as possible, in the meantime please use the Ethereum (ETH) app with Metamask.

### Accessing your Ledger Cube (CUBE) account via MetaMask.
Download and install the [MetaMask extension][mask] in your browser by following [these steps][steps].
Open MetaMask and create a standalone MetaMask account as shown in [this video][video].
